Emotion Recognition Artificial Intelligence based on Deep Learning and Spatio-Temporal Features.

*This project is still under development*

## Installation [Ubuntu 16.04 LTE]
1. Run `sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list` and change the line `deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted` to `deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main universe`

2. Run `install.sh`

## Contributing
At this stage, I don't even know if anyone is going to contribute. If by any chance you want to, you have to understand that I care about code quality. There are three alternatives:

(a) You make a PR and your code quality is great, so it will be directly merged to the repo :)

(b) You make a PR and your code quality sucks ass, so I will have to clean it :(

(c) You make a PR and your code quality sucks ass, but you don't mind getting feedback. In the merge, I will say what I believe that can be changed, you make those changes, and we can all learn together and be happy forever :D
